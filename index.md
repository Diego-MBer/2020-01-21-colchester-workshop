## CoDiMa CCP

[CoDiMa](https://www.codima.ac.uk/) is the Collaborative Computational
Project (CCP) in the area of Computational Discrete Mathematics,
supported by the EPSRC. It aims to support the ecosystem of users,
extenders and developers of open source mathematical software systems,
primarily [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/) and [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/),
encourage best practice in their use, and support more rapid uptake of
new features by their user and contributor communities.

Please visit [CoDiMa website](https://www.codima.ac.uk/) for further 
details about the project.

## Tools for Discrete Computational Mathematics

The aim of this workshop is to give an overview of modern techniques
for computational research using [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/)
and [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/). We plan to give introductions
to both systems, and combine lectures with practical sessions to give
participants an overview and an opportunity to practice a number of
techniques:
- use Git and GitHub to publish code and collaborate with others
- run tests to check that their code works correctly
- automate tasks with UNIX shell scripts
- run distributed computations with GAP and SageMath
- publish reproducible experiments using
[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) running on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).

For the practical sessions, you are encouraged to bring your own code
from experiment that you run with GAP or SageMath in the past, or
have a particular problem that you would like to tackle with their
help. Please bring a laptop with a Mac, 
Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) 
on which you have administrative privileges. A working installation
of GAP and SageMath is desirable. If you have problems with installing
them, we can try to resolve them in the beginning of the workshop,
if time permits.

Further information will be posted on [the program page]({{ site.baseurl }}/program).
