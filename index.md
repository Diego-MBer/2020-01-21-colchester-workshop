## CoDiMa CCP

[CoDiMa](https://www.codima.ac.uk/) is the Collaborative Computational
Project (CCP) in the area of Computational Discrete Mathematics,
supported by the EPSRC. It aims to support the ecosystem of users,
extenders and developers of open source mathematical software systems,
primarily [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/) and [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/),
encourage best practice in their use, and support more rapid uptake of
new features by their user and contributor communities.

Please visit [CoDiMa website](https://www.codima.ac.uk/) for further 
details about the project.
